from app import app

# Remember the two app entities? Here you can see both together in the same sentence.
# The Flask application instance is called app and is a member of the app package.
# The from app import app statement imports the app variable that is
# a member of the app package. If you find this confusing, you can rename either
# the package or the variable to something else.
